**Clustering for Digital Expansion Strategy**
The objective of this analysis is to develop a clustering process to support a digital expansion strategy, focusing on understanding the unique characteristics of each city. This will help achieve a 7% increase in MURE (Monthly Unique Restaurants) by tailoring strategies to the specific needs of different clusters.

To meet this goal, we identified the need to increase the Customer Health Score (CHS) by 19.7%. This growth must be distributed across clusters based on their specific characteristics and potential. Below, we outline the methodology used to allocate this growth effectively among the clusters.

*Main Steps of the Analysis*
* Calculation of the Total Growth Required in CHS\
Using the adjusted OLS model, we determined the total growth needed in CHS to achieve the target of a 7% increase in active restaurants:

  **Total CHS Growth=19.7%**

* Distribution of Growth by Cluster\
Initially, the required growth was distributed based only on the current CHS of each cluster. However, this approach may be limited because it does not consider the potential impact of each cluster.

* Incorporation of Population into the Weighting\
The population of each cluster was included in the weighting for two main reasons:\
  Demographic Relevance: Clusters with larger populations have a higher potential impact on the total number of active restaurants.\
  Fair Distribution: Adjusting the required growth proportionally to the population ensures a more balanced and realistic allocation.

* Final Results\
The necessary growth in CHS was distributed proportionally to the size of each cluster’s population, resulting in adjusted values that reflect the expected contribution of each group:

     | **Cluster** | **Current CHS (Average)** | **Required Growth (pp)** | **Estimated Final CHS (%)** |
     |-------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
     | **0**       | 62.1                      | 8.2                       | 70.3                       |
     | **1**       | 73.2                      | 3.1                       | 76.3                       |
     | **2**       | 24.2                      | 3.4                       | 27.6                       |
     | **3**       | 73.4                      | 5.0                       | 78.4                       |

*Justification for Weighting by Population*\
Greater Impact Potential: Clusters with larger populations have more "critical mass," meaning growth in CHS in these clusters is likely to have a more significant effect on the total number of active restaurants.\

Strategic Realism: By weighting by population, growth efforts are directed toward areas with higher demographic density, optimizing resources and increasing the likelihood of achieving the target.\

Balanced Distribution: This approach ensures that no cluster is "overestimated" or "underestimated," creating a growth plan proportional to the real potential of each group.
