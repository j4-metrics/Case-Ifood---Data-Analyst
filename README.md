**Clustering for digital expansion strategy**

The goal of the respective case, is to built a clustering process to assist a digital expansion strategy, focusing in understanding the specifical characteristics of each city, that can help to improve in 7% the MURE (Monthly Unique Restaurants).

To achieve its objective I found that it's necessary increasy Customer Health Score (CHS) in 19,7%. This goal should be spreaded trhough the cluster depending on the specifical characterisitics of each one. Above we describe the metodology used to spread the increasy within clusters.

*Main Steps of the Analysis*
Calculation of the Total Growth Required in CHS
Using the adjusted OLS model, we determined the total growth needed in CHS to achieve the target of a 7% increase in active restaurants:

**Total CHS Growth=19.7%**

1- Distribution of Growth by Cluster
Initially, the required growth was distributed based only on the current CHS of each cluster. However, this approach may be limited because it does not consider the potential impact of each cluster.

*Incorporation of Population into the Weighting
The population of each cluster was included in the weighting for two main reasons:

Demographic Relevance: Clusters with larger populations have a higher potential impact on the total number of active restaurants.
Fair Distribution: Adjusting the required growth proportionally to the population ensures a more balanced and realistic allocation.

*Final Results
The necessary growth in CHS was distributed proportionally to the size of each cluster’s population, resulting in adjusted values that reflect the expected contribution of each group:

Cluster	Required CHS Growth
0	0.0948 (9.48 percentage points)
1	0.0364 (3.64 percentage points)
2	0.0391 (3.91 percentage points)
3	0.0582 (5.82 percentage points)
Justification for Weighting by Population
Greater Impact Potential: Clusters with larger populations have more "critical mass," meaning growth in CHS in these clusters is likely to have a more significant effect on the total number of active restaurants.
Strategic Realism: By weighting by population, growth efforts are directed toward areas with higher demographic density, optimizing resources and increasing the likelihood of achieving the target.
Balanced Distribution: This approach ensures that no cluster is "overestimated" or "underestimated," creating a growth plan proportional to the real potential of each group.
